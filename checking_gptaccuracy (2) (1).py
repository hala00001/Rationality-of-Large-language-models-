                "Can the patron assert a third-party claim against the bouncer to bring him into the action?",

Cooking meat outdoors in a commercial establishment violated a city health code regulation, designed to assure that the food was not exposed to flies and other insects. On windy days, smoke from the barbecue pit sometimes blew into a neighbor's backyard. Although most people would not be bothered by the smoke, the neighbor had extremely sensitive eyes. They watered and stung every time that he was exposed to any form of smoke. When the barbecue smoke drifted onto his property, the neighbor could not use his backyard."
                    "If the neighbor sues the restaurant because he often cannot use his backyard, will the neighbor likely prevail?",

The bicyclist required surgery on both his right ankle and his left leg."

The statute of limitations on the original debt is irrelevant to the assigned debt. The third party cannot use defenses that existed between the original creditor and debtor.\n\n3. While it's true that assignments don't need to be in writing (answer B), that's not the main reason why the creditor would prevail.\n\n4. Answer C is incorrect because the statute of limitations defense on the original debt doesn't affect the validity of the assignment of the separate $4,000 debt.\n\n5.
